# Object Oriented Programming
`Object Oriented Programming` is a programming model that uses the concept of ``object``.In Python everything is an object,and OOP helps in structuring code.

## Upsides:
- To increase the code readability.  
- Create objects that contain both data and functions.
- Facilitates code organization and maintenance.  
- The code executes from Bottom to Top.


# Class:
- `Classes` are the blueprints from which the objects are  created.
- They serve as the template for the objects and define their structure.  
- It tells how the object will look like.  
- It has atrributes (the characteristics an object will have) and methods (which functions an object can perform).
- The attributes and methods  maybe public, private or protected and can be accessed by dot(.).

# Object:
An `object` is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity.It has:    
-  state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute/property.  
-  behaviour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method.  
-  identity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name.


# Self:
`self` is a variable name used in Python methods to reference the instance of the class.
-  Like the pointers in C++.  
-  It binds the attributes with the arguments.  
-  It provides access to attibutes and methods.
