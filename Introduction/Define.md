# Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming is a programming model that uses the concept of ``object``.In Python everything is an object,and OOP helps in structuring code.

## Upsides:
- To increase the code readability.  
- Create objects that contain both data and functions.  
- The code executes from Botton to Top.


# Class:
- Classes are the blueprints from which the objects are being created.  
- It tells how the object will look like.  
- It has atrributes (the characteristics an object will have) and methods (which functions an object can perform).
- The attributes and methods  maybe public, private or protected and can be accessed by dot(.).

# Object:
An entity that has
-  state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute/property.  
-  behaviour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method.  
-  identity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;==>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name.
