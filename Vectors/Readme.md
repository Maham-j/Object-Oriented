## Scalar Vector Toolkit 🛠️

A Python toolkit for vector operations.

## 1. Task 1: Improve the Solution 🚀
   - Enhancements made for better performance, clarity, and user-friendliness. This includes code optimization, clear comments, and exception handling.

## 2. Task 2: Scalar Multiple of a Vector 🧮
   - Function: `scalar_multiply(vector, scalar)`
   - Computes the scalar multiple of a vector. Each component of the vector is multiplied by the provided scalar value.

## 3. Task 3: Unit Vector of a Vector 📏
   - Function: `unit_vector(vector)`
   - Computes the unit vector of a vector. The unit vector is obtained by dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude.

## 4. Task 4: Cross Product of Two Vectors ✖️
   - Function: `cross_product(vector1, vector2)`
   - Computes the cross product of two vectors. Ensure that both vectors are three-dimensional for a valid cross product.

## 5. Task 5: Vector Equality Test 🔄
   - Function: `vectors_are_equal(vector1, vector2, tolerance=1e-10)`
   - Checks if two vectors are equal within a specified tolerance. Useful for handling floating-point variations.
