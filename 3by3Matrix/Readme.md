Whether you are a student, researcher, or enthusiast, this class offers a comprehensive set of functionalities for handling 3x3 matrices with ease.

## Features 🚀

- **Matrix Initialization**: Create 3x3 matrices effortlessly with specified values or default to zeros.

- **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform element-wise addition and subtraction between two matrices seamlessly.

- **Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices following standard matrix multiplication rules.

- **Determinant Calculation**: Compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with a single function call.

- **Transpose Operation**: Obtain the transpose of a matrix for further analysis.

- **Identity Matrix Check**: Quickly determine whether a given matrix is an identity matrix.

## Getting Started 🏁

Initialize an instance of the `Mat3by3` class and dive into the world of 3x3 matrices. Utilize the provided static methods for various operations without the need for intricate calculations.

## Example Usage 💡

```python
# Create matrices
m1 = Mat3by3(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
m2 = Mat3by3(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Add matrices
result_addition = Mat3by3.add(m1, m2)

# Subtract matrices
result_subtraction = Mat3by3.sub(m1, m2)

# Multiply matrices
result_multiplication = Mat3by3.mul(m1, m2)

# Calculate determinant
determinant_value = Mat3by3.determinant(m1)

# Transpose matrix
transposed_matrix = Mat3by3.transpose(m1)

# Check if it's an identity matrix
is_identity = Mat3by3.isidentity(m1)
```
